This led me to develop what I now call the Special Theory of Relativity, published in 1905.\n",
       "\n",
       "In essence, it tells us that measurements of time and space are not absolute but depend on the observer’s relative motion. For example, if you were traveling very close to the speed of light—about 186,282 miles per second—your clock would tick more slowly compared to someone at rest. Likewise, objects would appear contracted in the direction of motion. It’s as if the universe itself conspires to keep the speed of light constant for all, no matter how fast you go.\n",
       "\n",
       "Later, I extended these ideas into the General Theory of Relativity, which is a bit more subtle. It describes gravity not as a force, as Newton thought, but as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Imagine placing a heavy ball on a stretched rubber sheet—that’s a simple analogy, though not perfect. The ball causes the sheet to bend, and smaller objects roll toward the larger one, mimicking gravitational attraction.\n",
       "\n",
       "What’s truly wonderful—and perhaps a little humbling—is that these ideas reveal the universe to be a dynamic, interconnected fabric. Space and time are not separate entities but woven together into a single, four-dimensional tapestry. And through it all, the speed of light acts as a universal speed limit—a cosmic speedometer, if you will.\n",
       "\n",
       "Relativity has taught me that our perceptions are but slices of a deeper reality, one that is often stranger and more beautiful than we imagine. It’s a reminder that the universe’s secrets are always waiting to be uncovered, provided we approach them with curiosity and humility.</td></tr></table>"
